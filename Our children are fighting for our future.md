# Amy, we are not helpless anymore.
## Our children are fighting for our future.

### **Amy, I tried** —

Holding on  
to the lines on my face  
Counting months,  
for aren’t they shorter?  
February, came  
Soon after December.

Years went by.  
I can no longer remember  
What you said to me on the stairs  
about bicycles, and the future.

### Amy, I tried —

Holding on  
To the shirt you gave me  
In October.  
The one, that isn’t frayed on the back  
and the right shoulder.

I am buying an Indian this year  
I am riding a bullet in the summer.

### Amy—

The salesgirl at the store  
I have been searching for her  
on the highway  
near our neighbors.

She said  
She will turn up for a job  
That I could give her.  
Will she turn up in the winter?  
She is tall, dark and going nowhere.

But Amy you see,  
She has a heart more golden and fair.  
She is going to be a soldier.

### Amy, I tried —

Holding on  
To the streets and the days.  
Counting them on all of my fingers.  
For aren’t they easier that way  
To remember?

I am packing again for a berth in a railcar  
Where I will mistake love  
For some desire.

### Amy —

I dream of a son,  
and a sister.  
A candy colored clown and a lover.  
Looking at faces I reckon I hate  
But aren’t we all  
are we all brothers?

I am counting words  
in my computer.  
For isn’t it easier that way,  
My unfinished letters to my daughter.

### Amy —

I am thinking about wars  
Faraway and near  
Indignation  
I have nothing to fear.

### Amy —

We are not helpless  
Our children are fighting for our future.
